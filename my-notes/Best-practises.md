### Best Practices for Reading Tables in Databricks using PySpark

#### 1. **Row Files & Data Storage**:

- **Parquet**: Use Parquet as the default file format. It's columnar storage, offers efficient compression and encoding schemes, and is optimized for query performance.
- **Partitioning**: Partition large datasets by columns that are frequently filtered on. This reduces the amount of data read during queries.

#### 2. **Medallion Architecture**:

- **Bronze**: Raw data ingestion layer. Data is ingested as-is without any transformation.
- **Silver**: Cleaned and enriched data layer. Data is processed, cleaned, and might be enriched with additional data sources.
- **Gold**: Aggregated or further refined data. This is the layer that business users typically query against.

#### 3. **Schema**:

- **Schema Evolution**: Enable schema evolution when writing data to handle changes in the schema over time.
- **Schema Enforcement**: Ensure that the schema is enforced to prevent bad data from entering the system.

#### 4. **Security**:

- **Fine-grained Access Control**: Use Databricks' built-in access controls to restrict access to tables and data.
- **Data Masking & Redaction**: Mask or redact sensitive data before storing it.
- **Encryption**: Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

#### 5. **Data Quality Checks**:

- **Null Checks**: Check for unexpected null values in critical columns.
- **Duplicate Checks**: Ensure there are no duplicate rows or values where they shouldn't exist.
- **Range Checks**: Validate that values in specific columns are within expected ranges.

#### 6. **Reading Tables**:

- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed tables in memory for faster access.
- **Pushdown Predicates**: Take advantage of predicate pushdown to reduce the amount of data read from the source.
- **Use Delta Lake**: Delta Lake offers ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unified batch and streaming source.

#### 7. **Reading Files**:

- **Avoid Small Files**: Small files can cause a lot of overhead. Aim for larger files, typically in the range of 128MB to 1GB.
- **Use Wildcards**: When reading multiple files, use wildcards to read them in a single command.

#### 8. **Creating Views**:

- **Temporary Views**: Use temporary views for intermediate processing. They exist only for the duration of the Spark session.
- **Global Temporary Views**: These are shared among all sessions and kept alive until the Spark application terminates.
- **Persisted Views**: For frequently used transformations or aggregations, consider creating persisted views.

---

### Additional Tips:

- **Optimize Cluster Configuration**: Ensure that the cluster is appropriately sized for the workload. Use autoscaling to handle varying workloads.
- **Monitor & Logging**: Use Databricks' built-in monitoring tools to keep an eye on job performance and troubleshoot issues.
- **Documentation**: Always document the purpose of tables, views, and the transformations applied. This helps in maintaining and understanding the data pipeline.

### Best Practices for Reading Files from External and Internal Locations

#### 1. **External Locations (e.g., SharePoint)**:

- **APIs & SDKs**: Use official APIs or SDKs provided by the platform. For SharePoint, consider using the SharePoint REST API or SDKs.
- **Incremental Pulls**: Instead of pulling the entire dataset every time, use timestamps or identifiers to pull only the new or changed data.
- **Error Handling**: External systems can be unpredictable. Implement robust error handling, including retries with exponential backoff.
- **Secure Connections**: Always use secure connections (e.g., HTTPS) when accessing external data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of any rate limits imposed by the external system and ensure your requests stay within those limits.

#### 2. **Internal Locations (e.g., Azure Storage)**:

- **Authentication**: Use managed identities or service principals for authentication. Avoid hardcoding credentials.
- **Optimized File Formats**: Use columnar storage formats like Parquet or Delta for better performance.
- **Partitioning**: Store data in partitioned folders (e.g., by date) to optimize read operations.
- **Data Lifecycle**: Use Azure Blob Storage lifecycle policies to automatically transition data to cooler storage tiers or delete old data.
- **Consistency**: Ensure data consistency, especially if multiple processes are writing to the same location.

#### 3. **Dealing with Schema**:

- **Schema Inference**: While Spark can infer schema, it's often better to provide an explicit schema to avoid surprises.
- **Schema Evolution**: If using Delta Lake or similar technologies, enable schema evolution to handle changes gracefully.
- **Schema Validation**: Before ingesting data, validate against the expected schema to catch anomalies early.
- **Column Pruning**: Only select the columns you need. This can significantly improve performance.
- **Handling Nested Data**: If your data has nested structures, decide whether to flatten it or keep it nested based on your query needs.
- **Data Types**: Ensure that the data types in your schema match the actual data. Mismatches can lead to errors or data loss.

#### 4. **General Best Practices**:

- **Batching**: If dealing with large volumes of data, read in batches rather than all at once.
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed datasets in memory for faster subsequent access.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Monitor data ingestion pipelines. Log any anomalies or errors for troubleshooting.
- **Documentation**: Document the data source, schema, and any transformations applied. This aids in transparency and troubleshooting.


### Additional Tips:

- **Test Environment**: Before deploying any data ingestion pipeline to production, test it in a staging environment with real-world data scenarios.
- **Backup**: Always have a backup strategy, especially for critical data.
- **Collaboration**: Collaborate with the data source owners, whether internal or external, to understand any nuances or changes to the data structure.

Certainly! The term you're referring to is likely the "Medallion" architecture, often called the "Delta Architecture" or "Bronze-Silver-Gold" architecture in the context of Databricks and Delta Lake. This architecture is a modern take on the traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, emphasizing iterative refinement of data.

### Medallion Architecture Explained:

1. **Bronze (Raw Layer)**:
    
    - This is the raw data ingestion layer. Data is ingested as-is without any transformation.
    - It serves as a landing zone for raw files.
    - Data is typically stored in its native format.
2. **Silver (Cleaned & Enriched Layer)**:
    
    - Data is cleaned, processed, and might be enriched with additional data sources in this layer.
    - It's a transitional layer where data is made ready for analysis but might not be in its final form.
    - Data is typically stored in a columnar format like Parquet or Delta for optimized querying.
3. **Gold (Business Ready Layer)**:
    
    - This is the final layer where data is aggregated or further refined.
    - The data in this layer is what business users and analysts typically query against.
    - It's optimized for performance and business reporting.

### Dealing with Locations and Tables:

1. **Bronze Layer**:
    
    - **Location**: Create a dedicated directory or path in your storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3) for the Bronze layer. This could be something like `/bronze/`.
    - **Tables**: Tables in this layer represent raw datasets. For example, if you're ingesting raw sales data, you might have a table named `raw_sales_data`.
2. **Silver Layer**:
    
    - **Location**: Similarly, have a dedicated path like `/silver/`.
    - **Tables**: After cleaning the raw sales data, you might have a table in this layer named `cleaned_sales_data`. This table would have processed data with anomalies removed, missing values handled, and perhaps enriched with additional information.
3. **Gold Layer**:
    
    - **Location**: Use a path like `/gold/`.
    - **Tables**: Tables in this layer are optimized for business queries. From the cleaned sales data, you might create an aggregated table named `monthly_sales_summary` that provides a monthly breakdown of sales metrics.

### Best Practices:

1. **Partitioning**: Especially in the Silver and Gold layers, partition data by frequently queried columns (like date) to optimize read operations.
2. **Data Retention**: Implement data retention policies. Raw data in the Bronze layer might not need to be retained indefinitely once it's been processed into the Silver layer.
3. **Schema Evolution**: As your data evolves, ensure that your tables can handle changes in schema, especially in the Silver and Gold layers.
4. **Monitoring & Validation**: Regularly monitor the data flow from one layer to another. Implement data validation checks to ensure data quality is maintained across layers.
5. **Access Control**: Implement fine-grained access control. While data engineers might need access to all layers, business analysts might only need access to the Gold layer.

### Example:

Imagine you're ingesting data from an e-commerce website:

1. **Bronze**: Raw logs of user activity are stored. This includes everything from page views to purchase events.
2. **Silver**: These logs are cleaned to remove bots or any irrelevant activity. Data might be enriched with product information or user profiles.
3. **Gold**: Data is aggregated to show metrics like daily active users, conversion rates, and average purchase values.

The locations in your storage might look like:

- `/bronze/user_activity_logs/`
- `/silver/cleaned_user_activity/`
- `/gold/daily_metrics/`

Tables would evolve in complexity and refinement as you move from Bronze to Gold.
